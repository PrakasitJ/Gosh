# GO# (Gosharp) or Gosh

## Look, I love Go. But sometimes... ugh.

You know that feeling? You're cruising through Go, loving the speed, loving the simplicity. But man, I love OOP. I love Java, C#, and them. Go's got no actual classes, no try-catch, weird syntax sometimes.

And you're just sitting there like... "why tho?"

So I built Gosh for the love of the game. Life's too short to choose between performance and developer happiness.

## What's the deal?

**Go is FAST.** Like, real real fast. But it's missing some love:
- No OOP (classes? inheritance? nah)
- No try-catch (good luck with that `if err != nil` ... millions of times)
- No enums (const spam go brrrr)
- No event-driven patterns
- No dependency injection
- No... you get it

**Gosh is the "yes, and" to Go's "no, but"**

Write OOP-style code that transpiles to pure Go. You get modern syntax with Go's legendary performance baked in. And, This might be the **fastest OOP language ever** right? Because under the hood, it's just Go. We're not interpreting. We're not adding runtime overhead. We're transpiling to native Go code and letting the Go compiler do its magic.

**Big Omega(Go performance)** - that's your floor, not your ceiling.

Java? Slower. C#? Slower. TypeScript? Don't even start. They're all battling JIT compilers and runtime VMs. Gosh just... becomes Go. That's it. That's the trick.

## How does this transpiler work?

```
Your .gosh file
    ↓
Lexer breaks it into tokens (char by char)
    ↓
Parser builds an AST (abstract syntax tree)
    ↓
Transpiler converts AST → pure Go code
    ↓
Go compiler goes brrrr
    ↓
Done
```

No VM. No interpreter. No runtime BS. Just straight Go performance with better syntax.

## Show me the goods

### Install & Run
```bash
gosh script.gosh              # Run it
gosh script.gosh --debug=true # See the Go code it generates
```

### Syntax (it's dead simple)

**Imports** - throw 'em at the top:
```gosh
import fmt math strings;
```

**Variables** - type come first:
```gosh
int speed = 9999;
bool isAwesome = true;
string vibe = "immaculate";
```

**Math** - normal math:
```gosh
int result = (10 + 20) * 3;
int chaos = ((a + b) * c) / (d - e);
```

**Native Go escape hatch** - need raw Go? Use `::` (syntax was actually added for debugging, but let's keep it):
```gosh
int x = 42;

:: fmt.Println("The answer is", x)
:: if x > 40 {
::     fmt.Println("We're in the big leagues now")
:: }
```

---

## Full Example

```gosh
import fmt math;

int radius = 10;
float area = math.Pi * float(radius * radius);

:: fmt.Printf("Circle area: %.2f\n", area)
:: fmt.Println("This ran at Go speed, btw")
```

**What you write** ↑

**What runs** ↓

```go
package main
import ("fmt" "math")

func main() {
    radius := 10
    area := math.Pi * float64(radius * radius)
    fmt.Printf("Circle area: %.2f\n", area)
    fmt.Println("This ran at Go speed, btw")
}
```

## For you, yes YOU reading this

If you're an early adopter of this project: good luck with debugging and breaking prod. It's gonna be a pain in your ass. But man, in the end, if all this works, you'll be part of the **fastest OOP language ever created**.

If you wanna add something, contribute something, or just vibe - let's talk.
